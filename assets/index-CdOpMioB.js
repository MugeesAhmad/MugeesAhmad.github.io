Governments struggle to manage global climate change, disruptive technologies, wealth and income disparities, refugee and migration issues, and many other challenges. Civil institutions are also struggling as the societies they serve are increasingly polarized. </p><p class="my-5 text-justify text-DarkGrey"> Education, skills development, and training are critical in managing the forces of change, contributing to peace and prosperity, and positioning individuals to succeed. Universities are increasingly asked to play a leadership role in ensuring social stability and economic prosperity. To do so, they will need to challenge traditional models of education and prepare to be even more innovative. </p><p class="my-5 text-justify text-DarkGrey"> Supporting entrepreneurship creatively offers a positive path to meeting these challenges. The number of startups worldwide is increasing, offering technological advances that provide groundbreaking solutions while creating jobs and economic independence, bridging socio-economic divides, promoting collaboration, and fostering adaptive, creative thinking. However, our current model for supporting entrepreneurship needs to change. The failure rate of startup companies is concerningly high. </p></div><div class="mx-5 my-16 flex justify-center md:mx-0"><div class="relative"><img loading="lazy" src="'+B+'" alt="" class="mx-auto max-sm:scale-110"></div></div></div><p class="my-5 text-justify text-DarkGrey"> The Fulbright Canada Entrepreneurship Initiative aims to play its part by helping entrepreneurs be more successful.

It will pilot in Canada and the United States during 2024-25.
