Governments struggle to manage global climate change, disruptive technologies, wealth and income disparities, refugee and migration issues, and many other challenges. Civil institutions are also struggling as the societies they serve are increasingly polarized. </p><p class="my-5 text-justify text-DarkGrey"> Education, skills development, and training are critical in managing the forces of change, contributing to peace and prosperity, and positioning individuals to succeed. Universities are increasingly asked to play a leadership role in ensuring social stability and economic prosperity. To do so, they will need to challenge traditional models of education and prepare to be even more innovative. </p><p class="my-5 text-justify text-DarkGrey"> Supporting entrepreneurship creatively offers a positive path to meeting these challenges. The number of startups worldwide is increasing, offering technological advances that provide groundbreaking solutions while creating jobs and economic independence, bridging socio-economic divides, promoting collaboration, and fostering adaptive, creative thinking. However, our current model for supporting entrepreneurship needs to change. The failure rate of startup companies is concerningly high. </p></div><div class="mx-5 my-16 flex justify-center md:mx-0"><div class="relative"><img loading="lazy" src="'+B+'" alt="" class="mx-auto max-sm:scale-110"></div></div></div><p class="my-5 text-justify text-DarkGrey"> The Fulbright Canada Entrepreneurship Initiative aims to play its part by helping entrepreneurs be more successful. This initiative provides a unique and comprehensive program to help startup founders succeed – from idea to exit. It builds on Fulbright Canada’s other successful programs. It brings together partners – universities, traditional accelerators, and world-class web-based support systems – to provide tailored support to entrepreneurs across the entire lifecycle of their company and to allow the program to grow rapidly and eventually extend into underserved ecosystems. It will pilot in Canada and the United States during 2024-25. We are proud that our inaugural partners are Fulbright Canada and Alacrity Canada. </p><p class="my-5 text-justify text-DarkGrey"> The Fulbright Canada Entrepreneurship journey begins with a structured scholarship offered in different formats to meet each founder&#39;s needs. The scholarship is followed by intense mentorship at an Alacrity accelerator. Fulbright Canada entrepreneurs have access to the Startup Science platform through this entire journey and beyond – continuing to benefit from it throughout their company’s lifecycle.Supporting the Fulbright Canada Entrepreneurship Initiative allows us and our partners to join in creating significant, impactful, and positive change for individuals, communities, and society. Each participating entrepreneur offers the possibility to effect positive change and make a real difference. Please help us be part of that difference.
